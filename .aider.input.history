+Code the following app
+```
+1. Build a monthly expenses app. 
+Minimal Home Dashboard
+What to show: Total spent this month, Remaining budget, and A simple progress bar or ring chart. 
+2. One-Tap Expense Entry
+Design ideas: A big “+” button fixed at the bottom or center. 
+Open a lightweight sheet with: amount → category → optional note. Smart defaults (e.g., last used category, auto-date)
+3. Simple Category Icons
+Ideas: Use clean, recognizable icons (🍔 Food, 🚗 Transport, 🛍 Shopping, etc.) Limit the color palette to avoid overwhelm. Optional custom categories hidden behind an “Edit” button. 
+4. Soft Color Palette
+Suggestions: Neutral background (off-white or light gray). 1–2 accent colors for highlights. Avoid harsh or saturated colors. 
+5. Clear Monthly Timeline
+Display options: List view grouped by dates (e.g., Today, Yesterday, Earlier This Month). Tiny category icons beside each expense. Swipe left to delete / edit.
+6. Simple Graphs
+Ideas: Bar chart: categories vs. amount. Weekly spend line chart. Keep interactions minimal (tap a bar to see details). 
+7. Hidden Advanced Options. Keep things simple but offer depth only when needed: Export CSV, Recurring expenses, Notifications and reminders, Put these in a clean Settings screen.
+8. Frictionless Onboarding. Ideas: Let users skip account creation. Ask only: currency, starting budget, paycheck cycle. Use illustrations or subtle animations to guide. 
+9. Consistent Design Pattern. Use the same pattern across the app: Rounded corners. Soft shadows. Consistent spacing. Clear hierarchy (bold for titles, medium for subtitles, light for details). 
+10. Celebrate Saves. Add small delightful moments: Confetti or a happy icon when staying under budget
+A simple weekly summary card: “You saved $32 this week!”
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
